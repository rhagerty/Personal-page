            My early career has been in automotive MfgE until
            2019 when I left automotive in pursuit of a more fulfilling career path. I hadn’t
            found my previous positions challenging and was lacking the passion to return to
            engineering. I
            spent a few months traveling and then began working as a
            personal trainer <sub>Exhibit 1</sub> while I pondered my next transition. </p>

            Quarantine brought a swift end to my personal training career, but helped me rediscover
            the
            extent of my engineering “brain” as I found myself passing
            time building household solutions. E.g. I couldn't find a spice cart to fit beside my stove
            and decided to build <sub>Exhibit 1</sub> my own. I crave complex mental
            stimulation and began researching career paths that would satisfy this need for
            mental engagement and variety.

        <p>My fascination with technology, computers, and coding began before I can remember. As a
            preteen I
            dabbled with html styling for my social media pages (anyone remember LiveJournal or
            Myspace??)
            and was an avid video gamer. It didn't take long before I discovered
            the
            kismet connection between my technical brain and computer savvy, and made the decision to
            transition to software engineering. </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Enter: Springboard's Software Engineering Bootcamp </h3>
        </p>
        <p>I dove head first
            into the curriculum and was engrossed with the continuous challenges and daily “puzzles” I
            was
            solving using the type of logic that I enjoy (math?! algorithms?! Oh yes!). I’m
            reinvigorated with passion for this
            newfound career choice, and in my current job search I’m focusing on companies with a strong
            culture
            where my passion can be collaborated with other incredibly passionate individuals.
            Essentially,
            I’m looking to make an impact and accept a challenge!</p>
